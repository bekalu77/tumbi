🔗 Database Models (Relational Example):

  profile_picture: string
}

🚀 Notes for the AI or Dev Tool:

All buttons (Add/Edit/Delete/View) must be wired to the database.

Ensure only owners of the product/company can edit or delete their entries.

Use role-based access if needed (e.g., admin, user).

All popups (products/companies) should be dynamic and reusable.

Use responsive design for mobile/desktop views.

Use modern, clean UI components (Material UI / Tailwind CSS).

Support multilingual interface (at least English + Amharic toggle).
